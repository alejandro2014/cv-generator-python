# CV Generator

This python program generates a cv using the library fpdf, using a json file to store the personal information. The advantage of this is mainly the separation between data and representation, and being able to modify the CV easily

## Requeriments
The generator requires the installation of the following libraries in order to work:
- _fpdf_ for the pdf generation primitives
- _pillow_ for the logos of the companies
